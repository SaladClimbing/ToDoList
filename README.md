# ToDoList
A simple, to do list made with c# forms. Nothing fancy.

## Features
This is a simple program if you want a base to innovate on. A list of features that would be great to add would include:

- Saving items
- Deleting items
- Styles
- Sharing
- And many more!

I would love to see what everyone can come up with, so if you do end up adding something or doing something with this project, please share them.
